# MyCollectionMonitor

#
This application measures the market performance on any given day for a desired item or collection of items. Gone are the days of owning a physical collection, whether it’s sneakers, luxury bags, coins, bills, stamps, trading cards, vintage video games, etc., showing that collection off to friends, and forgetting what you purchased it for. No more searching on Ebay for the current market price or searching Google for the item’s original MSRP. This application will organize and digitize your inventory, allowing you to see the latest updates with a flick of a finger. <br> Users will be able to upload items and catalog the details of their purchase. Entering the date and price of purchase will save those values into the app for later reference. Through the Ebay API, users will be able to see the average sell price in the sold listings of the specific item. However, information can also be inputted manually. The main feature of the application will show the change in return on investment (ROI) of the item by percentage and dollars. Flex faster, boast better, sell higher!
